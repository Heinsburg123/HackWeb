It will provide an introduction to each topic, an overview of its supporting algorithms, and examples of products powered by the technology. Particular emphasis will be had on Machine Learning and developing hands-on practical skills with this technology. Upon completion of this course, students will obtain a wider scope of understanding about modern AI trends in software technology and develop an intuition for how this software works. To succeedin this course, students will need a fundamental understanding of data structures and programming fundamentals. Graph and tree data structures will be used in particular. Programming assignments in this class will be done using Python. Experience in at least one programming language is required and it s strongly recommended you have some Python experience before starting. A mathematical foundation in statistics and linear algebra is not strictly necessary but will deepen understanding of course material. Open to senior and junior Computer Science majors only.

Reinforcement learning algorithms repeatedly answer the question \"What should be done next?\", and they can learn via trial-and-error to answer these questions even when there is no supervisor telling the algorithm what the correct answer would have been. Applications of reinforcement learning span across medicine (How much insulin should be injected next? What drug should be given next?), marketing (What ad should be shown next?), robotics (How much power should be given to the motor?), game playing (What move should be made next?), environmental applications (Which countermeasure for an invasive species should be deployed next?), and dialogue systems (What type of sentence should be spoken next?), among many others. Broad topics covered in this course will include: Markov decision processes, reinforcement learning algorithms (model-based/model-free, batch/online, value function-based, actor-critics, policy gradient methods, etc.), and representations for reinforcement learning. Special topics may include ensuring the safety of reinforcement learning algorithms, hierarchical reinforcement learning, theoretical reinforcement learning, multi-agent reinforcement learning, and connections to animal learning. This course assumes a very strong mathematical background in calculus, linear algebra, and strategies for proving theorems. We will emphasize hands-on experience in class and through assignments, which will require implementing and applying many of the algorithms we discuss. Therefore, a strong background in programming is also necessary, as we will require that students implement sophisticated learning algorithms using C++ and/or Python. Finally, we assume that students have a background in machine learning (COMPSCI 589 or 689) and artificial intelligence (COMPSCI 683). Open to graduate Computer Science students only. 3 credits.\n",

      "In this course we examine the important problems in operating system design and implementation. The operating system provides a well-known, convenient, and efficient interface between user programs and the bare hardware of the computer on which they run. The operating system is responsible for allowing resources (e.g., disks, networks, and processors) to be shared, providing common services needed by many different programs (e.g., file service, the ability to start or stop processes, and access to the printer), and protecting individual programs from one another. The course will start with a brief historical perspective of the evolution of operating systems over the last fifty years, and then cover the major components of most operating systems. This discussion will cover the tradeoffs that can be made between performance and functionality during the design and implementation of an operating system. Particular emphasis will be given to three major OS subsystems: process management (processes, threads, CPU scheduling, synchronization, and deadlock), memory management (segmentation, paging, swapping), file systems, and operating system support for distributed systems. This course counts as a CS Elective for the CS Major. Open to senior and junior Computer Science majors only. Prerequisite: COMPSCI 230 with a grade of 'C' or better. 4 credits.\n",
