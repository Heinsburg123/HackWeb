To achieve this goal, his research focuses primarily on two key problems:\\xa0(1)\\xa0how to design general-purpose RL algorithms capable of autonomously decomposing complex tasks into simpler sub-problems, for which specialized reusable and composable skills be can be learned; and\\xa0(2)\\xa0how to ensure that these skills are learned in a way that meets user-specified safety requirements with high probability. These are fundamental questions that underlie the gap between what artificial intelligence agents can — in principle — do and what we can effectively get them to do given our current algorithms.\\xa0\\n\\nThe ultimate goal of da Silva's work is to design the necessary tools so that reinforcement learning algorithms can be widely used to solve challenging real-world tasks in homes and in the workplace, in a safe way, and with as little human intervention as possible.\\xa0\\n\\nMore broadly, da Silva's research interests lie in the intersection of machine learning, reinforcement learning, optimal control theory, and robotics, and include the construction of hierarchical policies, active learning, open-ended learning, biologically-plausible intrinsic motivation mechanisms, Bayesian optimization applied to control, and machine learning algorithms with high-probability safety and fairness guarantees.\\xa0 \\nDa Silva joined the faculty of the Manning College of Information and Computer Sciences (CICS) as an assistant professor in 2021. Prior to joining UMass, da Silva was an associate professor at the Institute of Informatics at the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul (UFRGS), in Brazil. Before that, he worked as a postdoctoral associate at the Aerospace Controls Laboratory at MIT (2015). \\nDa Silva received his PhD in computer science from the University of Massachusetts Amherst (2014), under the supervision of Prof. Andrew Barto. Both his MSc (2007) and BS\\xa0cum laude\\xa0(2004) degrees are in computer science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. Da Silva has worked, on several occasions, as a visiting researcher at the Laboratory of Computational Neuroscience in Rome, developing novel control algorithms for humanoid robots. He has also worked at Adobe Research, in California, developing large-scale machine learning techniques for digital marketing optimization.\\xa0 \\nDa Silva has published in top AI, machine learning, and robotics conferences and journals, including ICML, AAAI, IJCAI, and Science. He also received multiple Distinguished Reviewer and Distinguished Senior Program Committee Member awards. Da Silva regularly serves as a senior program committee member and as a reviewer for most premier conferences on machine learning and robotics, including NeurIPS, ICML, AAAI, IJCAI, AAMAS, UAI, IROS, ICRA, ICLR, RLDM, JAIR, and JMLR. He received the Outstanding Teaching Assistant Award in Computer Science; an award granted by the University of Massachusetts and sponsored by Yahoo! for innovations in teaching and training. In addition to his research, da Silva is also passionate about teaching and encouraging women and other underrepresented groups in computer science to pursue STEM careers. \\nLINKS \\nWebsite.

He is currently serving as Associate Dean of Research and Engagement and directs the Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR). He previously spent five years as a systems programmer/analyst at Dickinson College and (in today's vernacular) was co-founder of a startup selling email software in the 1980s. \\nProfessor Allan's research focuses on information retrieval, event-based information organization, as well as minimally interactive retrieval and organization. He also explores how novelty can be incorporated into retrieval algorithms, techniques for querying across languages, and methods for recognizing controversial or misleading information in text on the internet. \\nProfessor Allan serves on the organizing and program committees for major conferences in the area (SIGIR, CIKM, WSDM, etc), has been an associate editor of ACM's Transactions on Information Systems (TOIS) journal and Elsevier's Information Processing and Management (IPM) journal, and has served as chair of the SIGIR organization. He is currently on the editorial board of Foundation and Trends in Information Retrieval. With his students, he received Best Paper awards in SIGIR in 2001 and in 2006 as well as a Best Student Paper from CHIIR in 2017. He also received a SIGIR Test of Time Award for a 1998 paper on event detection and tracking. In 2018, he was elected to the CRA Board of Directors and then to the CRA Executive Committee as Treasurer. \\nLINKS \\nHomepage.

Classically, data management has focused on structured data, but it now also includes a variety of complex data types and settings. These include textual data, semi-structured data, graph-structure data, and continuous data streams, as well as data (regardless of type) that is incomplete, imprecise, or which represents probabilistic assertions rather than known facts. \\nData management research is increasingly multi-disciplinary, including aspects of theory, machine learning, operating systems, programming languages,\\xa0information retrieval,\\xa0and many others.\\xa0At its core, data management seeks to enhance the capabilities of systems that deal with data, and, together with statistics and machine learning, is one of the pillars of the emerging discipline of Data Science. \\nRelated faculty \\nJames Allan \\nInformation retrieval, event-based information organization, controversy and misinformation detection. \\nLaura Haas \\nLaura Haas.

They provide user interfaces to simplify the information-seeking \"conversation\" between user and machine. IR research makes this possible and drives constant improvements for the future. \\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) strives to get computers to understand human language.\\xa0NLP has seen enormous progress, but current systems have a very shallow understanding of the rich subtleties in language.\\xa0Our research integrates machine learning and computational linguistics to better extract knowledge and insights from text corpora, such as analysis of social media, news, scholarly articles, and computational social science applications.\\xa0NLP is inherently multidisciplinary, and NLP-related research at UMass also involves our colleagues in linguistics and the social sciences.\\xa0 \\nRelated faculty \\nJames Allan \\nInformation retrieval, event-based information organization, controversy and misinformation detection. \\nMohit Iyyer \\nMohit Iyyer.
